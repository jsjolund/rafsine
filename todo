* Compute border lattice sites, copy while computing the rest.
* Plot array on each GPU, gather to GPU0 when rendering is requested.
* Implement greedy voxel meshing for 3d visualization.
* Dynamic ordering of lattice 3D dimensions, continuous axis should have least cross section according to model.
* Add back averaging, and transient boundary conditions from CSV.
