Thanks to the people at RISE SICS North for helping me during my master thesis work, in particular my external supervisor Jon Summers. Also thanks to my internal supervisor Johan Carlson at Lule\r{a} University of Technology (LTU), Anna-Lena Ljung at LTU, as well as fellow student Rickard Nordlander for proofreading and comments on the thesis work. I would also like to thank Emelie Wibron for providing measurements and drawings of the data center modules at RISE SICS North.
